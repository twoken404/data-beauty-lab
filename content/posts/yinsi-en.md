## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

## 3. Google Services & Third-Party Sharing

**3.1 Google Analytics**
We use Google Analytics to understand our website traffic and user behavior. Google Analytics collects data such as your approximate geographical location (derived from IP), device information, and browsing behavior on our site. This data is aggregated and anonymized for analysis. You can learn more about how Google uses your data and opt-out options here: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

**3.2 Google AdSense**
We use Google AdSense to serve ads. Google uses cookies and device identifiers to display ads based on your visits to our Site and other sites on the internet. This practice is known as interest-based advertising. You can manage your ad preferences or opt-out of personalized advertising through Google's Ad Settings: [Google Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/).

**3.3 General Third-Party Disclosure**
We do not sell your personal information. We only share data with trusted third-party service providers (like Google) as necessary for them to perform services for us (analytics and advertising), under strict contractual obligations of confidentiality.

## 4. Cookies

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may limit your use of certain features on our Site. For a comprehensive understanding of our use of cookies, please refer to our dedicated [Cookie Policy] (if you have one, otherwise you can state "We use cookies as described in this policy").

## 5. Your Rights (CCPA/GDPR & Other Regulations)

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data:
*   **Access & Portability:** Request a copy of the data we hold about you.
*   **Correction:** Request correction of inaccurate data.
*   **Deletion:** Request deletion of your personal data.
*   **Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing:** Under laws like the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. While we do not sell data in the traditional sense, activities like using Google AdSense for personalized ads may be considered "sharing" under some laws. To opt-out, you can use the global privacy control signal or contact us directly.
*   **Objection:** Object to our processing of your data.
